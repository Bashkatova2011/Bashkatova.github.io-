        <p>Hi, My name is Anastasiia. Originally I am from Ukraine but now I live in San Francisco Bay Area. And since it is a Silicone Valley and there are a lot of opportunities I want to try myself in web development and Web Design. </p>
        <p>I have two Masters, one in International Economy and second in Finance, but lately I discovered that this is not what I want to do for a living, so I started to lern front-end. So to achive a certificate I need to complete all needed classes and then maybe I will change my whole career. </p>

        <p>Traveling more often than not involves venturing out into the unknown. It involves traveling to a new place, meeting new people and engaging in new experiences. As travelers, we naturally have an adventurous spirit. It is part of who we are, and the more we travel, the more we feed this spirit. Adventure is our normal.</p>
